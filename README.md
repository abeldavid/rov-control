The control system for Vortex NTNU's ROVs. The repository contains several ROS packages. Each package has a readme inside.

## Preferred workflow
* Create a feature branch for each new feature, solved issue, significant refactoring, etc.
* Run any applicable tests before merging.
* Merge into master when you are confident that your changes work as you intended.
* Use `git merge --no-ff your-branch` to preserve history.
