# This file defines the thrust characteristics for the Vortex Terrapin in-house
# thruster, that is, the relationship between thrust in newton and the width
# in microseconds of the PWM signal to the AfroEsc motor controllers running
# BlueRobotics firmware.

thrusters:
  rate_of_change:
    max: 1 # Maximum rate of change in newton per second for a thruster
  characteristics:
    thrust: [0, 0]
    pulse_width: [0, 0]
